    "# Seaborn Grid Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we continue our coverage of seaborn by focusing on plotting functions that return 'grids'. These are seaborn objects that wrap matplotlib's figure and usually contain more than one axes. There are a few different kinds of grids; some plot each group on a different axes, while others enhance the main plot on the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grids by categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Many grid plotting functions split the data by unique category values. Take a look at the [Categorical section][0] of the API. The very top function, `catplot`, is the only grid plot in that group. The others are axes plots. The `catplot` function is capable of making each of the other plots in its section. It can be thought of as a 'metaplotting' function, as it just uses the other underlying plots in its section. Let's start with `catplot` and read in our Airbnb listings data setting the style to whitegrid.\n",

    "We now pass the pairwise correlation matrix between each group into the `clustermap` function. It rearranges the column order so that columns in the same cluster are next to one another in the plot. It is possible that groups are negatively correlated with one another, but we are interested in finding those similar to one another. Because of this, we set the color for any correlation below .05 to the first color of the colormap, which is white for `hot_r`. We also set the last color to be mapped to the maximum correlation found above."

    "A sophisticated procedure called hierarchical clustering is used to find similar meetup groups. There is no definitive number of clusters returned with hierarchical clustering. It's up to you to decide what constitutes a cluster. Both the heat map and the dendogram (tree diagram) can be used to determine the number of clusters. The heat map is usually a better source to see clusters and they will be visible as square regions where most of the columns are all correlated relatively high with one another. I chose three broad categories for clusters and labeled them by looking at the names of the meetup groups. This selection was done arbitrarily.\n",
