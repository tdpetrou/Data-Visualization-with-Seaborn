    "# Seaborn Axes Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces the seaborn visualization library in Python. seaborn has a high-level, easy-to-use interface for creating powerful and beautiful visualizations. Like pandas, seaborn relies entirely on matplotlib to do all of the actual plotting. The library is fairly minimal and exposes relatively few functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The seaborn API\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the [seaborn API page][1] to get a nice overview of the library. The top of the API shows the below sections that contain most of the plotting function in the library. The other sections cover less important topics such as making specific grids and aesthetics. This chapter focuses only on the plots in these sections.\n",

    "* Relational\n",
    "* Categorical\n",
    "* Distribution\n",

    "* Matrix\n",

    "### Axes and Grid plots\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the seaborn plotting functions return either a matplotlib axes or a seaborn grid. As the name implies, these axes plots use a single matplotlib axes. Grid plots are more complex and are composed of a matplotlib figure with multiple axes. From the five sections in the API above, `relplot`, `catplot`, `lmplot` and `clustermap` are the only grid plots. These will be the focus of the following chapter. In this chapter, we focus on the axes plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A different categorization of plots\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the seaborn API, you'll notice a section on categorical plots. Unfortunately, this isn't labeled properly as there are multiple distribution plotting functions such as box and violin plots in that section. Instead of using seaborn's classification, I like to divide the plotting functions into the following three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distribution plots** - These plots show the distribution of some set of points of a continuous valued variable. Examples of these are box, violin, histogram, and KDE plots.\n",
    "* **Grouping and aggregating plots** - These plots group by some categorical variable and aggregate another. Examples of these plots include bar, count, and point plots.\n",
    "* **Raw data plots** - These plots do not do change the underlying data other than display it. Some examples are scatter and line plots along with heatmaps.\n",
